    "## Assumptions\n",
    "### General\n",
    "1. Clear accumulator (CLR) resets the accumulator. No address is present in the accumulator\n",
    "2. Execution stops after the end statement. The code written after the end statement is not executed.\n",
    "3. START does **not** need to be specified in the code and it is treated as a comment if it is used\n",
    "4. Label name **cannot** be an opcode name and cannot have a Macro name anywhere in it. For example if ADDTWO is a macro, then: \"SUB\",\"ADD\",\"ADDTWOXYZ\" are invalid Labels. While this can be handled easily, it is not considered to be a good programming practice.\n",
    "5. Comments can be added with the help of  **; or /**\n",
    "6. Variable names and label names can be alpha-Numeric. However, the same variable cannot be used as a label name and vice versa\n",
    "7. Literals can be of any value, memory is allotted accordingly.\n",
    "9. If the size of the literal uses more than 1 memory space, then only the first is shown in the machine code. Remaining memory mapping can be seen from the LiteralTable\n",
    "9. The maximum memory size = 12 bits"

    "3. SAC,INP,DSP,LAC should have an address/Variable (not a constant)\n",
    "4. DIV should have first parameter as address, variable or constant, second and third can be address or variable but not a constant"
