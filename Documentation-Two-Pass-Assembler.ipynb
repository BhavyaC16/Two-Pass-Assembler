    "## Assumptions\n",
    "### Opcode and Operands\n",
    "1. CLA and STP take no operands/arguments\n",
    "2. LAC, SAC, INP, DSP take 1 operand which is an address\n",
    "3. ADD, SUB, MUL, DIV take 1 operand which can be a literal or an address \n",
    "4. BRZ, BRN, BRP take 1 operand which should be a valid label\n",
    "5. If DIV is called, the quotient and remainder get stored in Variables R1 and R2 which can be used in the code later. If DIV is called again, then the value in R1 and R2 will get overwritten.\n",
    "6. SAC and INP can take undefined address as an argument. Rest of the opcodes cannot. (If no valid value is present in an address, it is treated as an undefined address)\n",
    "\n",
    "### General\n",
    "1. Clear accumulator (CLA) resets the accumulator. No address or value is present in the accumulator.\n",
    "2. Execution stops after the end statement. The code written after the end statement is not executed.\n",
    "3. START loads the instructions from the specified address. If no address is specified, instruction set is loaded normally.\n",
    "4. Label name **cannot** be an opcode name and cannot have a Macro name anywhere in it. <br> For example if ADDTWO is a macro, then: \"SUB\", \"ADD\", \"ADDTWOXYZ\" are invalid label names. While this can be handled, it is not considered to be a good programming practice.\n",
    "5. Comments can be added with the help of  **; or /**.\n",
    "6. Literals/Constants can be specified between single quotes \"''\". Example `ADD '3'`\n",
    "6. Variable names and label names can be alpha-numeric. However, the same variable cannot be used as a label name and vice versa.\n",
    "7. Literals can be of any value, contiguous memory spaces are allotted accordingly.\n",
    "8. If the size of the literal uses more than 1 memory space, then only the first is written in the machine code. Exact memory mapping can be seen from the LiteralTable.\n",
    "9. The maximum memory size is 256 words, which can be stored using 8 bit addresses. If the program size is greater than this, the assembler will throw an error and terminate.\n",
    "10. Total instruction length is 12 bit: 8 bit instruction address + 4 bit opcode"
