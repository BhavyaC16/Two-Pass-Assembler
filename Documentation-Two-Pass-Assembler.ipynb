    "## Assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "### General\n",
    "1. Clear accumulator (CLR) resets the accumulator. No address or value is present in the accumulator.\n",
    "2. Execution stops after the end statement. The code written after the end statement is not executed.\n",
    "3. START does **not** need to be specified in the code and it is treated as an assembler directive if used.\n",
    "4. Label name **cannot** be an opcode name and cannot have a Macro name anywhere in it. <br> For example if ADDTWO is a macro, then: \"SUB\", \"ADD\", \"ADDTWOXYZ\" are invalid label names. While this can be handled easily, it is not considered to be a good programming practice.\n",
    "5. Comments can be added with the help of  **; or /**.\n",
    "6. Variable names and label names can be alpha-numeric. However, the same variable cannot be used as a label name and vice versa.\n",
    "7. Literals can be of any value, contiguous memory spaces are allotted accordingly.\n",
    "9. If the size of the literal uses more than 1 memory space, then only the first is written in the machine code. Remaining memory mapping can be seen from the LiteralTable.\n",
    "9. The maximum memory size is 4096 words, which can be stored using 12 bit addresses. If the program size is greater than this, the assembler will throw an error and terminate."

    "2. For opcodes BRP, BRN and BRZ, operand should be a defined valid label.\n",
    "3. For opcodes SAC, INP and LAC, operand should be an address/variable (not a constant).\n",
    "4. For the opcode DSP, operand should be a declared adress/variable, and not a constant.\n",
    "4. DIV should have first parameter as declared address/variable or constant, second and third can be address or variable but not a constant. "
