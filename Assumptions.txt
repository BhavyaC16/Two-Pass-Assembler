Assumptions:
1. Macro is defined at the top of the file before the code where macro is used
2. Clear accumulator results in constant value 0 in the accumulator
3. Symbol table contains only Labels since variables are not given
4. All defined label names should be unique even for the macros else the code will throw multiple label definitions error

Design:
1. Data table contains all the addresses defined in the main code
2. Macro table contains the macro definition and the opcodes used in it
3. Opcode table is a list containing all the opcodes encountered in the main program stored in order 
4. When a macro call is encountered, the opcodes present in the macro table for the respective macro definition is substituted in the main opcode table
5. Symbol object
6. Literal Object
7. Data Set of addresses
8. Opcode Object
7. Macro table
