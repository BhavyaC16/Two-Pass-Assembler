Assumptions:
1. Macro is defined at the top of the file before the code where macro is used
2. Clear accumulator results in constant value 0 in the accumulator
3. Label table is used instead of symbol table as variables are not given, here symbol table will only have labels
4. Execution stops after the end statement. The code written after the end statement is not executed.
5. The maximum memory size= 12 bits
6. Operands:
	1. For add,mul,lac,dsp and sub operand should be a defined address or a constant (cannot be an undefined address)
	2. For brn , brz, brp should have a defined valid label 
	3. sac,inp should have a defined or undefined address (not a constant)
	4. div should have first as defined address or constant, second and third can be defined or undefined address but not a constant

7. The number of parameters supplied to macro = number of parameters supplied during call
8. Label definition cannot be an opcode name

Design:
1. Data table contains all the addresses defined in the main code
2. Macro table contains the macro definition and the labels, parameters and instructions used in it
-- do we need this? 3. Opcode table is a list containing all the opcodes encountered in the main program stored in order 
4. When a macro call is encountered, the instructions present in the macro table for the respective macro definition is substituted in the main instruction table
5. Explain the structure of the tables used

Pseudocode for first pass:
declare END found variable

while instruction is available and END is not encountered:
	if instruction empty line
		skip line
	if end
		break
	is instruction a comment
		if yes remove comments

	is instruction macro definition
		put macro definition in dictionary
		while mend is not encountered
			add the instruction to macro table/dictionary
			nextline
		if mend is not encountered at all then throw error

	what is the length of the instruction

	does instruction[0] have a label of the form li:
		if label is not previously defined:
			if yes put it in the label label
		else throw multiple definition error

		in this case instruction[1] is opcode remaining is operand
		else instruction[0] is opcode, remaining is operand

	how many operands does the instruction have
	which opcode does the instruction have
	is the opcode a valid opcode
		does the num of operands match the required number of operands for your opcode
		if both yes put it in opcode table
			append instruction in the table
		else if is it a call to a macro
			if yes put the parameters in a list
			go to macro table and iterate over its instructions
				substitute fields with given parameters
				append substituted instruction in instruction Table
				put the opcode in the opcode table
				put label in label table
				handle errors
		if no throw incorrect number of operands error
